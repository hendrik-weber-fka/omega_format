# Licenses of requirements
The requirements are not modified in any way. So there should be no issue with licensing and commercial use. 
Anaconda is not mandatory for the usage of the library. It is just a helper for the installation process and can be ommitted on install. Also PyQT5 and pyqtgraph can be omitted on install. Then the visualization will not be available.
